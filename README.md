# Aircraft-Damage-Prediction-
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and other sources. It aims to identify the critical factors contributing to aviation accidents and enhance safety understanding within the aviation industry.

Objective
The primary goals of the project are:

Risk Assessment of Aircraft Models and Engines: Investigate whether specific plane models or engine types are more prone to accidents, and analyze their safety records.
Weather Condition Analysis: Examine the weather conditions contributing to aviation accidents and determine the factors leading to such incidents.
Correlation Between Engine Numbers and Survivability: Analyze whether aircraft with more engines have a higher likelihood of survivability in accidents.
Flight Phase Risk Evaluation: Identify which phase of flight (takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, landing) poses the greatest risk for accidents.
